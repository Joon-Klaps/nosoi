nosoi (pronounced no.so.i) is a flexible agent-based stochastic epidemiological simulator in R, named after the *daimones* of plague, sickness and disease that escaped Pandora's jar in the Greek mythology. Nosoi is able to take into account the influence of multiple variable on the transmission process (e.g. dual-host systems (such as arboviruses), within-host viral dynamics, transportation, population structure), alone or taken together, to create complex but relatively intuitive epidemiological simulations.
