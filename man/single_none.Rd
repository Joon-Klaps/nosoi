\title{Single-host without spatial features}
\usage{
single_none(length.sim, max.infected, init.individuals, timeContact,
  pTrans, param.pTrans, pExit, param.pExit, prefix.host = "H", ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{length.sim}{specifies the length (in unit of time) over which the simulation should be run.}

\item{max.infected}{specifies the maximum number of hosts that can be infected in the simulation.}

\item{init.individuals}{number of initially infected individuals.}

\item{timeContact}{function that gives the number of potential transmission events per unit of time.}

\item{pTrans}{function that gives the probability of transmit a pathogen as a function of time since infection.}

\item{pExit}{probability to exit the simulation for an infected host (either moving out, dying, etc.).}

\item{...}{other arguments to be passed on to the simulator (see below).}
}
\description{
Single-host without spatial features
}
\details{
This function runs a single-host, without any spatial features, epidemiological simulation on a single core.

The simulation stops either at the end of given time (specified by length) or when the number of hosts infected threshold is passed.
